SELECT AlbumId, COUNT(TrackId) AS Nr_of_tracks
FROM tracks
GROUP BY AlbumId
ORDER BY Nr_of_tracks DESC

--2-Find the album title of the tracks. Your solution should include track name and its album title.

SELECT t.Name, a.Title
FROM tracks t
JOIN albums a ON t.AlbumId=a.AlbumId

--3-Find the minimum duration of the track in an album. 
--Your solution should include track name, album id, album title and duration of the track 
--sorted from highest to lowest.

SELECT t.name, t.AlbumId, a.Title, MIN(t.Milliseconds) AS Min_Duration
FROM tracks t
JOIN albums a ON t.AlbumId = a.AlbumId
GROUP BY t.AlbumId
ORDER BY Min_Duration DESC

--4-Find the total duration of each album. 
--Your solution should include track name, album id, album title and its total duration 
--sorted from highest to lowest.

SELECT t.name, t.AlbumId, a.Title, SUM(t.Milliseconds) AS Total_Duration
FROM tracks t
JOIN albums a ON t.AlbumId = a.AlbumId
GROUP BY t.AlbumId 
ORDER BY Total_Duration DESC


--5-Based on the previous question, find the albums whose total duration is higher than 70 minutes.

SELECT t.name, t.AlbumId, a.Title, SUM(t.Milliseconds) AS Total_Duration
FROM tracks t
JOIN albums a ON t.AlbumId = a.AlbumId
GROUP BY t.AlbumId 
HAVING Total_Duration > 4200000
ORDER BY Total_Duration DESC
